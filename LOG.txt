TODOs:
- see graph_prof.py for questions to ask
- profile by type, add additional statistics


NOTES:
- comment out in starter_code.graph_transformation to see only graph because the processing code has very long outputs that exceed the terminal memory
- don't edit graph_tracer.py -- just use
- main work in graph_prof.py and then obviously doing the activation checkpointing
- mu-Two paper and https://pytorch.org/docs/2.5/fx.html will be helpful
