TODOs:
Phase 2: Activation Checkpointing algorithm (2 weeks - 20%)
Using the inputs from the profiler, implement the activation checkpointing algorithm in Î¼-TWO that 
decides the subset of the activations to be retained and the subset of the activations to be recomputed.
- activation_checkpoint.py: implement algorithm
- substitute into benchmarks.py (perhaps with an additional flag to perform acivation checkpointing)

DUE DATE:
- MAY 14


NOTES:
- don't edit graph_tracer.py -- just use
- main work in graph_prof.py and then obviously doing the activation checkpointing
- mu-Two paper and https://pytorch.org/docs/2.5/fx.html will be helpful
